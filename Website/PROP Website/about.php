                The event starts on Friday-evening and last the whole weekend. The event takes place nearby camping "Park Kuierpad" (see appendix A for a map of the camping). It should be possible to make a reservation for a camping spot on the camping ground.

                The entrance price for the event is 55 euro. The participant will get some kind of identification, for instance an arm brace with an RFID-chip, containing a unique identity number. This arm brace will be used at the entrance to check if the participant is allowed to enter the event. During the event the participant can use the arm brace to pay for food or drinks, etc. Or a participant gets ia unique identity number by e-mail. So if a visitor has made a reservation, he/she gets a confirmation e-mail with some information (as its name, date of reservation, his/her unique identity number, asking him/her to deposit some money to the bank account of the organiser of the event).
                Everyone, who makes a reservation for the event, should transfer an amount of money to the bank account of the organisation of the event. The company sets the balance of its event-account to his/her payment (minus the entrance price of course).
                A group of participants can book a camping spot by choosing a free spot on the map of the camping. Every spot can be booked for at most 6 persons.
                To make a reservation for a camping spot you should specify all participants and specify which one of them will get the bill. You can only make a reservation for the whole weekend; not for a single day. The price for a reservation for a camping spot is 30 euro plus 20 euro for every guest.
